Hunt is born on the 29th of May the year 1961 the town of Canning Town to May (nee Wicks) and George Hunt, the youngest of 13 children.</p><p>Hunt is identified as Metropolitan Police sources as being “too big to bring down”.&nbsp;Hunt became a close associate with and accomplice of Reggie Kray, visiting him in prison in the year 2000 prior to his passing.&nbsp;He was the manager of “Hunt’s Waste Recycling” in Dagenham that, during the 2012 Olympics final ceremony was the scene for the “largest fire in several years” in London that saw over 40 fire engines as well as more than 200 firefighters attend the scene.&nbsp;Today, it is called Connect Waste, the recycling facility is managed by long-time Hunt’s acquaintance, Phil Mitchell.</p><p>A police investigation into The Hunt Syndicate, codenamed Operation Tiberius, concluded that it had managed to evade prosecution through a mixture of utilising corrupt police contacts and the intimidation of witnesses. The crime gang were uncovered by the crime squad in Newham, East London in 2006, when a scrapyard in the Docklands area of East London was searched for stolen metal. When another nearby property was raided as part of that operation, 42 containers were unexpectedly discovered to contain the contents of 18 lorry thefts and a commercial burglary. Counterfeit goods were also seized. Dave McKelvey, head of the crime squad, discovered that the gang had been corrupting police officers for over a decade and that despite a gang insider leaking information to the police, the information was never acted upon. Despite overwhelming evidence, the case collapsed after a corrupt anti-corruption detective sent a dossier to prosecutors raising concerns about McKelvey, who was then investigated for two years (the investigation was found to be fatally flawed and McKelvey exonerated, with Detective Chief Superintendent Albert Patrick stating that he struggled to understand what McKelvey was being accused of). As a result of the raids, McKelvey was informed whilst interviewing a petty criminal that a known contract-killer had been contracted for £1 Million to kill 3 police officers including McKelvey himself, who now lives under round the clock police protection.</p><p>During the trial, The Sunday Times employed five professional bodyguards to protect their witnesses. On the second day of the trial the bodyguards walked off the job after being approached in a pub, with another security firm refusing to take the job on due to the dangerous reputation of the Hunt Syndicate. As the article had been based largely on leaked Serious Organised Crime Agency and police documents, the paper had to rely on these as evidence. When the paper approached the Metropolitan Police before publicly disclosing the leaked documents, the Met responded by unsuccessfully trying to sue them for the recovery of those documents and to obtain an order banning their publication. The Met also launched an internal investigation to try and identify the source of the leak. Sunday Times journalist Michael Gillard was named British Journalism Awards Journalist of the Year in 2013 for the expose, but was unable to attend the award ceremony due to security concerns meaning that he was unable to attend public events in London.</p><p align=justify>Hunt is a resident of The Morleys, a 7 bedrooms mansion in Woodside Green, Great Hallingbury close to the border of Essex and Hertfordshire near Bishop’s Stortford.&nbsp;The mansion is complete with a pool, tennis court gym, and dog pen for guard dogs The house was purchased in September 1993 for a price of P600,000.&nbsp;Then in 2013, the mansion was found that Hunt did not disclose any earnings or payment of taxes in the years between 1982 and and he was unable recall how he managed to finance the home.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=3.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>David Hunt</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>David</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Hunt</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rower</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>February 1</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1991</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pretoria</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>South Africa</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aquarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>George Hunt</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Stephen Hunt</strong></td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Patricia Heaton (m. 1990)</strong></td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Joseph Charles Hunt, Daniel Patrick Hunt, John Basil Hunt, Samuel David Hunt</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>David Hunt ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

It was also revealed that whilst owing The Sunday Times £805,000 in legal costs, Hunt was loaned £1 Million by former pornographer and newspaper owner and current West Ham United F.C. co-chairman David Sullivan.

A member of the Treasury Select Committee believed that the Financial Conduct Authority should investigate the loans.</p><h2>David Hunt Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>David Hunt is one of the <strong>richest Rower</strong> from South Africa.

Presented as a fictional book based on a career criminal called Billy Abrahams, it was in fact a thinly disguised autobiography of Holme’s time as a career criminal during the mid-80s and through to 1995, with the names of well known living gangsters’ names changed to avoid libel action. Hunt, referred to in the book as Abrahams’ “psychopathic partner in crime” Danny, is exposed as a violent gangland boss, who is responsible for numerous murders and serious assaults whilst running drug/porn/protection operations in London and Essex. Danny (David Hunt) falls out with Abrahams (Jimmy Holmes) and puts a contract out on his life. A follow up book titled “The Charity Committee” was re-written and published in July 2013, with the real names of the main protagonist included. The book is currently difficult to obtain, as it was withdrawn by Amazon due to a complaint from Hunt’s solicitors</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rower</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Amidst the Panama Papers leak of April 2016, it was revealed by The Guardian that Hunt was a client of Mossack Fonseca and owned an offshore company, EMM Limited, which held ownership of an iron and steel business in East London</p><p>In 2016 details of a plot to assassinate three police officers who were investigating Hunt were revealed in full detail in an episode of BBC’s Panorama.

Hunt was represented by Hugh Tomlinson QC, who is the chairman of the Hacked Off campaign and also a member of the Matrix Chambers group of barristers of whom Cherie Blair is a founding member. Tomlinson portrayed Hunt as a “rough diamond” who “was a misunderstood property tycoon whose only passions in life were his family and racing pigeons”, and argued that it was not in the public interest for the newspaper to have revealed how Hunt had been embroiled in a gangland turf war over land the Government had been due to buy in the lead-up to the Olympics.</p><h2>Who is David Hunt Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>David Hunt</strong> married to <strong>Patricia Heaton (m. 1990)</strong>.
