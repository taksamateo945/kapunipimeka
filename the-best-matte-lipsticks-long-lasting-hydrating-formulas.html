It also happens to last longer than the average lip tint or satin-finish lipstick, making it a must for big events and days when touch-ups aren’t an option. It’s no wonder that makeup artists turn to their trusted matte lipsticks for important occasions, like the red carpet and TV appearances, weddings, and other major moments when clients need to put their best face forward (without actually thinking about their face).</p><p>“The magic of matte lipsticks versus lipstick with a satin or high-shine finish is that they are super long-lasting and have the ultimate staying power compared to their glossy or satin finish counterparts,” says Olivia Todd, a UK-based makeup artist specializing in editorial and luxury bridal looks. “If my client is attending an all-day event, I typically opt for a matte lip,” celebrity makeup artist Jamie Greenberg agrees. “I trust that the matte formula will stay put and last all day without having to constantly reapply.” Because matte lipstick formulas are designed to set and dry in place, they do not smudge once applied. Taylor Swift’s iconic red lipstick is a great example of this phenomenon—even after performing a three-hour show, you can always trust her matte red lips to look perfectly fresh. Wondering which ones are her favorites? Keep reading, we have at least two on this list.</p><p>Whether you’re just dipping a toe into the wonderful world of matte lipstick or you’re looking to expand your collection with a bold new shade, look no further—we tracked down the best matte lipstick formulas of 2024 and got the scoop on each formula’s pros and cons from Todd and Greenberg. From hydrating formulas made to quench even the driest lips to designer options that deliver rich color with luxurious appeal, we’re obsessed with these matte lipsticks—and you will be, too.</p><p><span class="inline text-h5 text-seafoam-dark">Related Stories</span></p><h2>Best matte lipsticks, at a glance</h2><ul><li><strong>Best overall:</strong> Hourglass, Unlocked Soft Matte Lipstick, $38</li><li><strong>Runner-up:</strong> Pat McGrath Labs, MatteTrance Lipstick, $39</li><li><strong>Best luxury:</strong> Prada Beauty, Monochrome Soft Matte Refillable Lipstick, $50</li><li><strong>Best drugstore:</strong> L’Oreal, Colour Riche Intense Volume Matte Lipstick, $14</li><li><strong>Best budget:</strong> NYX, Soft Matte Lip Cream, $7</li><li><strong>Best pigment:</strong> Fenty Beauty, Stunna Lip Paint, $29</li><li><strong>Best sheer:</strong> Glossier, Generation G Lipstick, $20</li><li><strong>Best long-wearing:</strong> Pat McGrath Labs, LiquiLUST Legendary Wear Matte Lipstick, $34</li><li><strong>Best transfer-proof:</strong> Huda Beauty, Liquid Matte Lipstick, $23</li><li><strong>Best for dry lips:</strong> MAC, Powder Kiss Velvet Blur Slim Moisturizing Matte Lipstick, $28</li><li><strong>Best for mature skin:</strong> Chanel, Rouge Allure Velvet Matte Lipstick, $48</li><li><strong>Best shade range:</strong> Maybelline, SuperStay Matte Ink Liquid Lipstick, $11</li><li><strong>Best lipstick-liner hybrid:</strong> Laura Mercier, Velour Extreme Matte Lipstick, $22</li><li><strong>Best multipurpose:</strong> Haus Labs, Hy-Power Pigment Paint, $24</li><li><strong>Best environmentally-friendly formula:</strong> Violette_FR, Bisou Balm, $28</li></ul><h2>What to look for in a mate lipstick</h2><p>We love matte lipsticks for their rich color and velvety texture, but the main reason we reach for them time and again is longevity. But because they’re made to be smudge-proof, certain matte lipsticks can feel dry on the skin or emphasize chapped areas. If your lips tend to get dry and chapped easily, opt for hydrating matte lipsticks such as MAC Powder Kiss Velvet Blur Slim Moisturizing Matte Lipstick ($28) or Pat McGrath Labs LiquiLUST Legendary Wear Matte Lipstick ($34). “Those with dry skin should prep the lips beforehand with a hydrating lip balm or mask,” Todd advises. “If you have oilier skin, matte lipstick is a great option as it balances oil and will last all day.” She also notes that occasion plays an important role, so be sure to think about where and when you’ll be wearing matte lipstick. “A sophisticated evening occasion may call for a matte lipstick to add drama, whereas, for a fun daytime activity, a more natural or glossy look may be better suited.”</p><h2>What are the best shades for matte lipstick?</h2><p>Matte lipstick comes in a wide range of shades that look beautiful on every skin tone, so choosing the best one for you will come down to the look you’re trying to create. “A matte red is of course very chic and classic, but you can also create a very natural look using mauves, nudes, and pinks,” says Greenberg. “Just remember that matte lipstick can be as bold or as natural as you want it to be. Have fun with it!”</p><p>I personally own several matte lipsticks ranging from classic nudes to romantic pinks and coral, as well as a handful of vibrant pinks and deep reds. While I typically reach for the more vibrant colors when I’m heading out to a special event and want to make a bold statement, more often than not, I wear nude lipsticks from day to night. I love their versatility and the sense of polish they bring to my everyday makeup look—plus, I find that nude shades draw more attention to my eyes.</p><h2>Is matte lipstick ideal for mature skin?</h2><p>Good news for those with mature skin or particularly dry lips: matte lipstick can absolutely work for you. Just be sure to choose a lipstick that won’t settle into lines, and ensure that you’ve fully prepped your lips before applying it. “It’s important to take the proper steps to prevent any feathering or bleeding, as mature skin tends to have more fine lines surrounding the lip area,” Greenberg explains. “As long as you prep your skin and lips, anyone at any age can rock a matte lip.” She recommends Chanel Rouge Allure Velvet Matte Lipstick ($48) for mature skin, as it’s a super-hydrating formula that comes in a gorgeous selection of shades.</p><h2>Shop the best matte lipsticks</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Hourglass-Unlocked-Soft-Matte-Lipstick_falsexfalse_true_70.webp><p>Best overall: Hourglass, Unlocked Soft Matte Lipstick — $38.00</p><p>I was thrilled when Greenberg called out Hourglass Unlocked Soft Matte Lipstick as one of her all-time favorites because it’s mine, too! I can confidently extol the creamy, long-lasting benefits of this primer-infused lipstick, which delivers ultra-rich color that lasts all day. It comes in a beautiful array of romantic pinks, deep mauves, and sophisticated neutrals that work for a wide range of skin tones (I own three), plus it’s free of parabens, phthalates, mineral oil, and sulfates. “This lipstick has it all,” says Greenberg—and I agree. “It includes priming ingredients, which eliminate the need for an extra step in your routine, lasts all day and is available in a gorgeous selection of colors. It’s also vegan and cruelty-free, which is a huge plus.”</p><ul><li>Long-wearing</li><li>Full coverage</li><li>Hydrating</li><li>Vegan and cruelty-free</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Pat-McGrath-Labs-MatteTrance-Lipstick_falsexfalse_true_70.webp><p>Runner-up: Pat McGrath Labs, MatteTrance Lipstick — $39.00</p><p>Pat McGrath has achieved almost god-like status among celebrity makeup artists and beauty founders for many reasons, the main one being that her products are absolutely mesmerizing. Her MatteTrance Lipstick is no exception, delivering rich, opaque color with a soft and weightless feel. “This is one of the most comfortable matte lipsticks out there,” says Todd. “It gives you ultra-vivid matte color with just one swipe.” It also happens to be one of Taylor Swift’s go-tos and part of the Taylor Made Lip Kit ($68), a classic red affair featuring Taylor’s on-set duo: MatteTrance Lipstick in Rouge 8 and PermaGel Ultra Lip Pencil in Vengeance.</p><ul><li>Long-wearing</li><li>Hydrating</li><li>Rich pigment</li><li>Wide range of shades</li></ul><ul><li>Not 100 percent transfer-free</li><li>Packaging is somewhat fragile</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Prada-Beauty-Monochrome-Soft-Matte-Refillable-Lipstick_falsexfalse_true_70.webp><p>Best luxury: Prada Beauty, Monochrome Soft Matte Refillable Lipstick — $50.00</p><p>Love Prada’s style on the runway but not ready to invest in ready-to-wear? You’re in luck: Prada Beauty is here to bring a touch of luxury to your makeup arsenal. This refillable silver lipstick tube is a gorgeous accessory in its own right and we love the brand details that go right down to the product itself (note the faint but undeniably Prada nylon fabric print on the lipstick bullet). This creamy, long-lasting lipstick offers lightweight buildable coverage that lasts up to six hours and can be used to create soft or more accentuated matte looks. The formula is also incredibly moisturizing, thanks to ingredients like soothing jojoba oil and Bifidus extract, which helps to strengthen the lip barrier. When you inevitably use this gorgeous lipstick to its last swipe, simply order the refill size to cut down on unnecessary waste—very chic, indeed.</p><ul><li>Hydrating</li><li>Buildable</li><li>Wide shade range</li><li>Refillable lipstick tube</li></ul><ul><li>Pricey</li><li>Tends to dry quickly, so precision is key</li><li>Not as long-wearing as other lipsticks on this list</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/LOreal-Colour-Riche-Intense-Volume-Matte-Lipstick_falsexfalse_true_70.webp><p>Best drugstore: L’Oreal, Colour Riche Intense Volume Matte Lipstick — $14.00</p><p>When it comes to getting serious beauty for your buck, L’Oreal’s Colour Riche Matte Lipstick is in a category of its own.

These ultra-saturated shades are engineered to stay put for up to 16 hours, so you can eat, drink, smile, and kiss to your heart’s content.

With its buttery-smooth texture and highly pigmented formula, NYX Soft Matte Lip Cream is a fan-favorite of makeup artists and beauty editors alike. “NYX has a few matte formulas in their lineup, all of which feature long-lasting formulas at an affordable price point, but this is my favorite,” says Greenberg. “I only wish it came in a wider shade range, as I would love to see more reds in the lineup.” That said, it’s an excellent product for the price, coming in at only $7 a pop!</p><ul><li>Lightweight</li><li>Non-drying</li><li>Rich pigment</li><li>Affordable price</li></ul><ul><li>Limited shade range</li><li>Formula is not buildable</li><li>Not as long-wearing as other lipsticks on this list</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Fenty-Beauty-Stunna-Lip-Paint_falsexfalse_true_70.webp><p>Best pigment: Fenty Beauty, Stunna Lip Paint — $29.00</p><p>Leave it to Rihanna to create a matte lipstick that hits all the right notes.

It has a natural, blurred effect that gives your lips a flush of color, ideal for creating a just-kissed look. It’s also buildable, so if you prefer a more accentuated lip, you can do that too. As someone with perpetually dry lips, I love that this lipstick is made with skin-conditioning ingredients such as blue agave extract and vitamin E.

According to McGrath, Taylor’s been wearing her line’s LiquiLUST Legendary Wear Matte Lipstick in a red shade called Elson—which is probably the main reason why that shade and all the other shades of this lipstick are sold out on Sephora. But this lipstick is a hit for more reasons than one; the vegan formula has a luscious texture that hydrates lips and never feels drying. It also lasts for up to 12 hours and delivers bold, beautiful color that would make anyone look and feel like pop royalty.</p><ul><li>Long-wearing</li><li>Hydrating</li><li>Rich pigment</li></ul><ul><li>Limited range of shades</li><li>Not 100 percent transfer-proof</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Huda-Beauty-Liquid-Matte-Lipstick_falsexfalse_true_70.webp><p>Best transfer-proof: Huda Beauty, Liquid Matte Lipstick — $23.00</p><p>Huda Beauty’s Liquid Matte Lipstick is Todd’s go-to when she wants to create a lipstick look that absolutely will not budge. “This lipstick provides vibrant color, full coverage, and is totally flake, streak, and transfer-free,” she says. “The creamy, liquid formula dries down to a buttery, suede-like finish.” Because it’s made with moisturizing ingredients like olive oil and vitamins A and E, you’ll never have to sacrifice comfort for a totally transfer-proof pout.</p><ul><li>Long-wearing</li><li>Vegan</li><li>Fragrance-free</li><li>Transfer-proof</li></ul><ul><li>Comes in a glass tube that’s easy to break</li><li>Takes a while to dry and set</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/MAC-Powder-Kiss-Velvet-Blur-Slim-Moisturizing-Matte-Lipstick_falsexfalse_true_70.webp><p>Best for dry lips: MAC, Powder Kiss Velvet Blur Slim Moisturizing Matte Lipstick — $28.00</p><p>MAC has long been known for its bold and colorful products, so it’s no surprise that the brand’s moisturizing matte lipstick made our list. It combines the qualities of a lip balm and a matte lipstick to give your lips an intense splash of color that looks just as great as it feels. The velvety formula is infused with seed oils that hydrate and prevent it from drying out lips, while creating a filter-perfect finish that lasts for up to 12 hours. “This is a great option if you struggle with dry lips,” says Greenberg. “It is a softer matte thanks to the hydrating ingredients, so if you want a 100 percent dry matte formula, this may not be the best fit.”</p><ul><li>Long-wearing</li><li>Hydrating</li><li>Good for dry lips</li><li>Doesn’t settle into fine lines</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Chanel-Rouge-Allure-Velvet-Matte-Lipstick_falsexfalse_true_70.webp><p>Best for mature skin: Chanel, Rouge Allure Velvet Matte Lipstick — $48.00</p><p>As a beauty lover with chronically dry lips, I consider myself lucky to have found Chanel Rouge Allure lipstick early in life—my first designer makeup purchase was a classic red shade of Rouge Allure Luminous Intense Lipstick in 2007, and I’ve been a devotee ever since. According to Greenberg, I was on the right track: “Chanel is known for gorgeous lip formulas that are great for dry and mature skin,” she says. “The price is well worth it, as the formula is long-lasting and feels luxurious on the lips.” I own several Rouge Allure lipsticks including the Velvet Matte formulation and find it incredibly comfortable and moisturizing. It doesn’t settle into lip lines or stain dry skin—and sometimes I think it leaves my lips in better shape than they were when I applied it.</p><ul><li>Long-wearing</li><li>Hydrating</li><li>Excellent for dry and mature skin</li><li>Wide shade range</li></ul><ul><li>Pricey</li><li>Not transfer-proof</li><li>Not as long-wearing as other lipsticks on this list</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Maybelline-SuperStay-Matte-Ink-Liquid-Lipstick_falsexfalse_true_70.webp><p>Best shade range: Maybelline, SuperStay Matte Ink Liquid Lipstick — $11.00</p><p>No other lipstick on this list comes close to having the range of Maybelline’s SuperStay Matte Lipstick. Its 40 shades cover a wide spectrum of colors, from delicate nudes and pinks to powdery pastels, vibrant corals, and deep purple. There’s even a stunning inky-black shade for moments when you want to let your rebellious side shine.

The super-matte finish makes this lipstick incredibly long-wearing, so you’ll rarely have to reapply.” Because it sets so well, it may not be the best choice for those with drier lips—though prepping with lip balm and finishing with a light gloss may do the trick.</p><ul><li>Long-wearing</li><li>Rich pigment</li><li>Doubles as a lip liner</li><li>Wide shade range</li></ul><ul><li>May be drying for some skin types</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Haus-Labs-Hy-Power-Pigment-Paint_falsexfalse_true_70.webp><p>Best multipurpose: Haus Labs, Hy-Power Pigment Paint — $24.00</p><p>It’s no accident that we have lipsticks from three pop stars’ makeup lines on this list—not only are A-list performers like Lady Gaga, Rihanna, and Taylor Swift creators of culture and arbiters of taste, they know what it takes to make lipstick with staying power. Gaga’s Haus Labs in particular turns out some of the highest-performing products on the market, and its Hy-Power Pigment paint lives up to its name. Transfer-proof, long-lasting, and highly pigmented, this product is not just a lipstick; it can be used as eyeliner, eyeshadow, body paint, and more.

While there are only three shades, each is a sumptuous “couture” color blend that radiates warmth and mystery. It catches the light in a dimensional way that never looks flat and can easily be built up to create an ombre lip. Violette_FR surpasses the FDA’s cosmetic requirements for the U.S. and follows the stricter set of rules set forth by the European Cosmetic Directive for safe ingredient use.
