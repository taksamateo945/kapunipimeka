Congratulations were quickly conveyed in comments on the post by well-wishers.</p><h2>Details About Rob Kearney’s Net Worth</h2><p><strong>Rob Kearney</strong> has an estimated net worth of $14.8 million, according to Idol Net Worth.&nbsp;The athlete may have amassed such wealth as a result of his career victories in several contests and brand sponsorships.&nbsp;Kearney was named to the British and Irish Lions squad that traveled to South Africa in 2009. The rugby player made his Lions test debut, playing in the 26-21 defeat in Durban.&nbsp;On April 30, 2013, Rob was named to his second British & Irish Lions squad.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rob-Kearney-2.jpg alt="Rob Kearney" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>As a youth, the athlete played Gaelic with Naomh Mhuire and in the Cooley Kickhams underage system before joining the Cooley senior football club at the age of 17 in 2004 and Louth at the minor level.
