Celebrities are touting it. Doctors are hailing it as a research-backed breakthrough.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Its popularity has led to shortages, as people and their providers scramble to get their hands on a drug that has been shown to be incredibly effective for treating both diabetes and obesity. It’s a major medical advancement that could make a big difference.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ozempic (also known by the generic name semaglutide) was approved for use as diabetes medication in 2017. The makers of Ozempic call weight loss a ‘side effect,’ but it’s been shown in numerous research studies to be an effective option for treating the disease of obesity.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Providers can (and do) prescribe Ozempic ‘off-label’ for people who are living with obesity. Using a medication off-label means it’s prescribed for a use other than its stated purpose.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=femail-ccox>Source: </span><span class=mol-style-italic><span class=femail-ccox>Cleveland Clinic&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Constance came up with a plan to stop eating from 3pm onwards each day after finding some studies that outlined the apparent health benefits of evening fasting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I haven’t looked back.
