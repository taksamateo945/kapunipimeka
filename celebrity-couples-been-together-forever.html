Between dual careers (and dualing egos) and the prying eyes of the paparazzi,&nbsp;many&nbsp;of our favorite celebrity couples (<strong>Ben Affleck</strong> and <strong>Jennifer Garner, Brad Pitt</strong> and <strong>Jennifer Aniston—</strong>and their subsequent remarriages) just&nbsp;didn't have what it takes to go the&nbsp;distance.</p><p>That said, there are a surprising number of star couples who have made their love last. Some, like <strong>Felicity</strong> <strong>Huffman</strong> and<strong> William H. Macy</strong>,&nbsp;have said&nbsp;open communication&nbsp;is key, while&nbsp;others like <strong>Kelly Ripa</strong> and <strong>Mark Consuelos</strong>, believe fights are inevitable, but should make the relationship stronger in the end. Whatever their secret sauce may be, here are 20 celebrity couples who have been together for more than 10 years which, by&nbsp;Hollywood standards, is forever and a day.

He&nbsp;once told <strong>Oprah Winfrey</strong>, "I'm a lucky man. Rita could have done better, but, you know, every now and again, you win the lottery."&nbsp;One of&nbsp;Hollywood's most enduring couples were first linked after they met on the set of Bosom Buddies,&nbsp;&nbsp;the popular eighties sitcom that launched Hanks' career. The couple married in 1988 and have two sons, <strong>Chet</strong> and <strong>Truman Hanks.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/11/Beyonce-and-Jay-Z-e1534258110288.jpg><p><strong>Beyoncé</strong> has&nbsp;said she was 19 when she began dating <strong>Jay Z,</strong> so&nbsp;their relationship started in either 1999 or 2000. When they finally got married April 2008, they kept all the details about their nuptials a secret, which sent the tabloids&nbsp;on a wild goose chase. (They got their marriage license in Scarsdale, New York, while visiting one of Jay's lawyers.)</p><p>The couple have had&nbsp;their share of&nbsp;marital woes, to be sure, which were revealed when a tape was leaked of a&nbsp;physical&nbsp;fight between&nbsp;Jay and Queen B's sister,&nbsp;<strong>Solange</strong> <strong>Knowles,</strong>&nbsp;in an elevator after the Met Gala in 2014. It was reported that Solange was furious over her brother-in-law's alleged infidelity.&nbsp;Rumors of a break-up swirled&nbsp;at the time&nbsp;but Bey made "Lemonade" out of lemons and the couple, who are parents to&nbsp;<strong>Blue Ivy</strong> and twins&nbsp;<strong>Rumi</strong> and <strong>Sir Carter</strong>,&nbsp;seems tighter than ever.</p><p>"Nothing is harder than this. By far," Jay admitted when he talked about&nbsp;rebooting his marriage after the incident.&nbsp;"I'm telling you, it's the hardest thing I've ever done."

The stars made it official in 1988, one year before Back to the Future Part II was released.</p><p>The actor, who went public with his struggles with Parkinson Disease in 1998 (he was diagnosed in 1991) has said, "I wouldn't be&nbsp;alive today if&nbsp;it&nbsp;weren't for Tracy, I&nbsp;don't doubt that. When I&nbsp;told her about the Parkinson's I&nbsp;said to&nbsp;her, 'Are you in&nbsp;for this?' and she said, 'I'm in&nbsp;for it.'" They have four kids: <strong>Sam, Esme, Aquinnah,</strong> and <strong>Schuyler Fox.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><img decoding=async width=1024 height=680 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/Kyra-Sedgwick-Sosie-Bacon-Kevin-Bacon.jpg alt="Kyra Sedgwick Kevin Bacon Sosie Bacon" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p><strong>Kevin Bacon</strong> told TV host <strong>Stephen Colbert</strong>&nbsp;in 2014 that he first met his future bride when she was just a child. "She was a little girl, yeah, she was 12 years old," he said at the time.</p><p>With their seven-year age difference,&nbsp;(he was 19 at the time) they didn't start dating right then and there. It wasn't until they met again on the set of "Lemon Sky" in the '80s (when both were in their 20s) that they started their long love affair. The actors tied the knot on September 4, 1988. Sedgwick&nbsp;has said&nbsp;that she wasn't very attracted to Bacon initially, but&nbsp;he obviously grew on her. Today they have two kids, <strong>Travis</strong> and <strong>Sosie Bacon</strong>.</p><p><img decoding=async width=1024 height=682 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/08/Felicity-Huffman-and-William-H.-Macy.jpg alt="Felicity Huffman and William H.

For their 20th anniversary last year, Huffman&nbsp;took to Twitter to sing Macy's praises.&nbsp;"You took me home in '85," she tweeted. "Married me in '97. You give me a thrill every time you walk through the door. TY for marrying me 20 yrs ago today." She has explained the secret of their marriage this way: "Every day we&nbsp;sit down and make sure we&nbsp;take half an&nbsp;hour—each person gets 15&nbsp;minutes—just to&nbsp;talk, with no&nbsp;crosstalk. You kind of&nbsp;just deeply check in&nbsp;with the other person. You kind of&nbsp;actually see what's going on&nbsp;with the other person without any talk-back."</p><p><img decoding=async width=1024 height=733 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/08/shutterstock_624394667.jpg alt="Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>One of Hollywood's most&nbsp;successful romances started back in 1983 when the actors met on the set of Swing Shift. Though they've never technically married, the ageless actress (and mother of <strong>Kate Hudson</strong>) credits their&nbsp;longevity as a couple&nbsp;to communication. She told People, "You have to want to stay together and really want to. Therefore you work to be together."</p><p><img decoding=async width=1024 height=782 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/08/shutterstock_546494968.jpg alt="Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>SJP spilt from <strong>Robert Downey, Jr.</strong> and started dating the Ferris Bueller star in 1991.&nbsp;The couple, who live in New York City and are&nbsp;frequently spotted on public transportation around town,&nbsp;have three children: son&nbsp;<strong>James Wilkie</strong> and twin daughters<strong>&nbsp;Marion</strong> and <strong>Tabitha Broderick.</strong></p><p>"We're very devoted to&nbsp;our family and our lives.

You're gonna have at each other. We're gonna annoy each other and do stuff that irritates each other because we're human beings. But at the end of the day, we're loyal to each other, we care about each other deeply. We're good friends and, you know, relationships evolve and we just happen to be lucky enough that we evolved together. We grew together. Our roots became entangled."

Last year Crawford explained the secret to her successful marriage to The Daily Telegraph this way: "I make my husband a priority and don't take things for granted.

They finally married in October 1997 and are&nbsp;the parents of&nbsp;twins born in January 2006 via surrogate after years of trying to conceive.</p><p>Their strong religious faith is something they have both said is important in keeping their marriage strong. Vance has said, "I've learned that the Lord is first and that my wife is the most important thing on this earth. The decisions in our marriage aren't easier, but they are clearer because of our relationship with God." Bassett believes, "God brought me a husband who loves me.
